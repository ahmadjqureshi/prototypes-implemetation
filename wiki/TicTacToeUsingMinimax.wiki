= Tic Tac Toe Implementation using Minimax and alpha beta pruning =

Minimax algorithm finds out best move from a partial or complete game tree using depth first search. In this case we have 5 moves look ahead game tree on every move i.e. we do not generate whole game tree in start. Minimax is a recursive algorithm but we have done a non recursive implementation in order make it more performance efficient.


In our implementation every move has two heuristic values one for Player1 (always negative values) and other for Player2 (always positive values). Player1 is considered as Min and Player2 is considered as Max.
