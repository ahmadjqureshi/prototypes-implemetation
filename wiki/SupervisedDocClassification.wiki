= Supervised learning: Document classification using Support Vector Machines. =

In this project document classification is performed using Support Vector Machines on Reuters-21578 data set. RBF kernel was used for prediction, the values of C and gamma parameters were identified using cross-validation. The precision, recall and F-Measure were calculated to evaluate results, overall performance was promising.
