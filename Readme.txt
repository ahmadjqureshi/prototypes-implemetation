This is implementation of shortest path algorithm inspired from Dijkstra's Algorithm.

This algorithm generates tree of paths from graph which can be used to traverse shortest path.

graph.txt contains a sample graph.

Format of text file:

Line 1 contains number of edges e.g. N number of edges
Line 2 to N + 1 contains StartVertex EndVertex CostOfVertex
