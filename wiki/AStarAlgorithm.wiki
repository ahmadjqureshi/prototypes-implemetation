#summary Description of A* Algorithm

= A^*^ Algorithm =

A^*^ Algorithm falls in the area of informed searching algorithms. It is an extension to Dijkstra's algorithm with some intelligence in order to make Path Finding more efficient.

Lets assume f(n) a function which gives shortest estimated path to goal node through node n then:

f(n) = g(n) + h(n)

g(n) is the cost to reach node n
h(n) is the heuristic value from n to goal

A^*^ is an extended version of Shortest path algorithm with addition of heuristic function h(n)

An implementation of A^*^ algorithm can be found [http://code.google.com/p/prototypes-implemetation/source/browse/#svn%2Fbranches%2FA*%20Algorithm%253Fstate%253Dclosed here]
