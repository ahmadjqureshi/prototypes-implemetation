#Summary Shortest path algorithm description.

=Shortest Path Algorithm=

The implementation of Shortest path algorithm is based on Dijkstra's algorithm with some modifications for example it takes care of circular references or paths in a graph.

It finds all possible paths in a graph and generates a tree of path. When tree of all paths is created then it is possible to do a bottom up traversal to get all paths.

In the implementation the graph is constructed from collection of Edges. Each Edge consists of two Vertices i.e. start vertex and end vertex. Each Edge has weight.

The graph can be defined in a definition file. Please review graph.txt in source of shortestpathalgo.
