The purpose this project is to implement and demonstrate path finding algorithms e.g. Dijkstra, A Star, best first search etc. It also contains an image processing project which was implemented some years before for extraction of features from handwritten signatures.

*Shortest Path Algorithm*

The implementation of Shortest path algorithm is based on Dijkstra's algorithm with some modifications.

It finds all possible paths in a graph and generates a tree of path. When tree of all paths is created then it is possible to do a bottom up traversal to get all paths.
